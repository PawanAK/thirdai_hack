# Cogni: Multi-Functional Chatbot with NeuralDB and OpenAI

*Connecting Intelligence, Context, and Content*

Welcome to **Cogni**, an innovative application that leverages the power of the ThirdAI NeuralDB library and the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo language model to provide users with diverse conversational experiences. Cogni is designed to offer a range of functionalities:

## PDF Chatbot

Engage with PDF documents like never before! Cogni's PDF chatbot lets you upload PDF files and initiate conversations based on the content within them. Harnessing the capabilities of NeuralDB, the chatbot can analyze and retrieve information from uploaded PDFs. The OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo model will then assist in generating interactive and informative responses.

## Website Chatbot

Experience interactive browsing and chatting in one place. Cogni's website chatbot enables you to input a website link. The chatbot then uses the `ndb.parsing_utils.recursive_url_scrape` function to extract relevant content. Engage in a lively conversation with the extracted information, powered by both NeuralDB and OpenAI models.

## YouTube Video Chatbot

Have conversations with the content of your favorite YouTube videos. Provide a YouTube video ID, and Cogni's chatbot will leverage NeuralDB to retrieve pertinent content. Then, enjoy an engaging dialogue with the video's content, driven by the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo model.
